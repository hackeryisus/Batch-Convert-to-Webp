Weâ€™ll be using Google WebP Codec for this. To install it through terminal, follow below mentioned procedure:

On Linux (Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install webp
```

On MacOS:
```
brew install webp
```

On Windows:
```
choco install webp
```
Also make sure you have installed chocolaty package manager. To install just chocolaty just run following command in powershell (run as administrator):
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Once installed webp run the script open a terminal on the folder where the script was downloaded and run the script
```
sh webpconverter.sh
```

The script will ask you for the path to the folder where your images are located so copy and paste and press enter.
